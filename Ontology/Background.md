## Ontology

#### What Is An Ontology

An ontology is an explicit description of a domain:
* concepts
* properties and attributes of concepts
* constraints on properties and attributes
* individuals (often, but not always)

An ontology defines
* a common vocabulary
* a shared understanding

Ontology Engineering - defines terms in the domain and relations among them
* defines concepts in the domain (classes)
* arranges concepts in a hierarchy (subclass-superclass hierarchy)
*defines which attributes and properties (slots) classes can have and constraints on their values
* defines individuals and filling in slot values

#### Why develop an ontology

To share common understanding of the structure of information
* among people
* among software agents

To enable reuse of domain knowledge
* to avoid "re-inventing the wheel"
* to introduce standards to allow interoperability

To make domain assumptions explicit
* easier to change domain assumptions (consider a genetics knowledge base)
* easier to understand and update legacy data

To separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge
* re-use domain and operational knowledge separately (e.g., configuration based on constraints)

Compared to OO, ontology 
* reflects the structure of the world, not reflects the structure of the data and code
* is often about structure of concepts, not about behavior (methods)
* actual physical representation is not an issue, not describes the physical representation of data (long int, char, etc.)
